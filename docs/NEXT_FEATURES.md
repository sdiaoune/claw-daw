# Three new features I'd add next

1) **Metronome + count-in + tap tempo**
- Count-in before playback/recording
- Tap tempo to set BPM quickly
- Makes live usage and iteration much faster

2) **Pattern operations + variation tools**
- Duplicate pattern, copy/paste bars, rotate, reverse
- Velocity accent tools (e.g. accent every 4th hat)
- Turns patterns into a real beat-making workflow

3) **Render options + mastering presets**
- Stem export already exists; add:
  - master render presets ("demo", "loud", "clean")
  - optional limiter/softclip
  - automatic fade-in/out on export
